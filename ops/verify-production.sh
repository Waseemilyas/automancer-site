# script checks production itself, the way a visitor / crawler / AI agent
# meets it: pages answer 200, unknown paths are a REAL 404 (not a soft 404),
# llms.txt and the sitemap exist, the agent manifest and security.txt answer
# at their non-dot paths (GitHub Pages does not serve dot-prefixed paths —
# measured 2026-08-22, when /.well-known/* 404'd live while every dist/-only
# check stayed green), the legal footer anchor is on the homepage, and the
# TLS certificate is valid and not about to expire. Both

Usage: ops/verify-production.sh <base-url>

       ops/verify-production.sh --self-test
       ops/verify-production.sh --assert-sentry-bundle <js-file>

Verify that a deployed Automancer site serves correctly: page statuses,
real 404s, llms.txt, sitemap XML, agent.json + security.txt at their
non-dot paths, homepage footer anchor, TLS certificate, Sentry DSN for
the expected project (not merely "a" Sentry project).

--expected-revision is for the post-deploy gate. It also requires the
homepage proof strip to serve the first seven characters of the supplied
Git SHA. The assertion uses the same bounded 90-second retry window as the
other checks so a normal Pages rollout can finish without paging forever.

--self-test proves the checker itself can still fail AND pass: it drives
each independently-failable assertion against an isolated local fixture on
127.0.0.1 (never production) and asserts both failing and passing directions.

--assert-sentry-bundle runs only the Sentry project assertion against a
local JavaScript file (a fixture or a copy of a bundle). It never prints
a DSN. Used to prove the check against bytes that are not production.

<base-url> must be a BARE https origin:
  - https scheme is required (the check suite includes TLS certificate
    validation, which is impossible over http);
  - no trailing slash — route paths are appended directly, so a trailing
    slash would produce broken URLs like https://example.com//services;
  - no path, query string, fragment, userinfo or whitespace;
  - hostname of the form example.com, optionally with :port.

Examples:
  ops/verify-production.sh https://automancer.uk         # production
  ops/verify-production.sh --expected-revision "$GITHUB_SHA" https://automancer.uk
  ops/verify-production.sh https://preview.example.org   # a preview deploy
  ops/verify-production.sh --self-test                   # the checker checks itself
  ops/verify-production.sh --assert-sentry-bundle ./bundle.js  # local bundle only

# --- self-test ------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `--self-test` proves the checker itself can still fail AND can still pass.
# A check that can no longer fail is worse than no check: deploy.yml and
# uptime.yml both call THIS script, so a silently-green check mutes the deploy
# gate and the uptime monitor at once (measured defect, 2026-08-30). A check
# that can never succeed is as broken, and a dead-address self-test cannot see
# it — a red check against a dead address looks identical to a correct one.
#
# Each independently-failable assertion gets an isolated FAIL fixture and a
# passing control on a server bound to 127.0.0.1 only (never 0.0.0.0 — this box
# is shared). A permanently-green assertion fails the first direction; a
# permanently-red assertion fails the second.
#
# The TLS check's trust-chain half (openssl s_client against system roots)
# cannot have both directions faked locally: a self-signed fixture is,
# correctly, untrusted. Date parsing and the strict TLS_MIN_DAYS boundary are
# driven locally; trust-chain verification remains live-only and is exercised
# by deploy.yml, uptime.yml and every ordinary production run.
