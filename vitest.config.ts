 * Worker cap: this repo does not own the machine.
 *
 * Vitest sizes its pool from `availableParallelism()` by default, which on a
 * 20-core shared box means up to 19 workers from a single `pnpm test`. That is
 * antisocial anywhere more than one thing runs at a time — a shared build box,
 * a CI runner hosting several jobs, or a laptop doing anything else — and the
 * cost scales with the number of test files, so it gets worse silently as the
 * suite grows.
 *
 * Two is plenty here: the suite is I/O-light and the one-off production build
 * in globalSetup dominates the runtime anyway. Raise it deliberately with
 * VITEST_MAX_WORKERS=8 rather than by editing this file, so a machine that
 * genuinely has the headroom can say so without the default changing for
 * everyone else.
