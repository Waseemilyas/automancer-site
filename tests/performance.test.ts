/**
 * Page-weight budgets — the gate that makes regressions impossible to miss.
 *
 * Every budget below is derived from a MEASURED build of 2026-08-31
 * (one pass of every page against a fresh `PUBLIC_AUT_SENTRY_WEB_DSN=""`
 * build, matching the empty DSN the 2026-08-22 measurement used and that
 * `ci.yml`'s test job builds with; deploy.yml's Build step injects the same
 * variable from `vars.PUBLIC_AUT_SENTRY_WEB_DSN`. Full tables and method in
 * docs/PERFORMANCE.md). Budget = measured + headroom,
 * where headroom = max(1024, ceil(measured × 0.02)) — enough slack for
 * routine copy edits and Astro hashing noise, small enough that adding an
 * asset, font weight or dependency-sized script trips it. Never round a
 * budget to a number that "looks right": re-measure instead.
 *
 * If this test fails on a deliberate change: re-run
 *   node tests/support/perf-cli.ts --csv
 * against the fresh build, update the measured values here with the new date,
 * and explain the jump in docs/PERFORMANCE.md. A budget raised without a new
 * measurement is a guess, not a gate.
