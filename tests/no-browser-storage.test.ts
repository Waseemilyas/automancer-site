/**
 * /privacy makes a FALSIFIABLE FACTUAL CLAIM about this site's behaviour:
 *
 *   outside the contact-page security check, loading the site "sets no
 *   cookies and stores nothing in your browser"
 *
 * That is not marketing copy — it is the stated reason there is no cookie
 * banner. If any code starts writing to the browser, the notice becomes a
 * false statement to visitors and to a regulator, and the missing banner
 * stops being defensible.
 *
 * It has already gone wrong once. A UTM-capture snippet wrote `aut-utm` to
 * sessionStorage on any URL carrying utm_* params, which contradicted the
 * claim for months before the 2026-08-22 audit (AUT-6414) found it. It was
 * found by loading the live site, not by reading code — nothing in the repo
 * connected the snippet to the sentence it falsified. This test is that
 * connection, so the next one fails in CI instead of shipping.
 *
 * Scope and honesty about it:
 *   - This greps the BUILT OUTPUT — inline scripts and every emitted JS
 *     asset, so third-party bundles (Sentry) are covered too, not just our
 *     own source.
 *   - This is a STATIC scan of source text, not proof the APIs are never
 *     called. Adversarial review (AUT-6705, 2026-08-22) demonstrated that a
 *     computed reference — `window[["session", "Storage"].join("")]`,
 *     `document["cookie"]` — reaches the real API while evading a literal
 *     grep. This file exists because a static scan is fast, greppable, and
 *     names the exact offending line, which is worth keeping for the common
 *     case; the property this suite actually needs — proof the APIs are
 *     never CALLED, however they were referenced — is enforced by the
 *     behaviour-level check in tests/support/storage-sentinel.ts below,
 *     which actually executes the built page and cannot be evaded by
 *     spelling a reference differently.
 *   - Neither check can see storage written by a cross-origin iframe
 *     (Cloudflare Turnstile). That was checked by observation in the same
 *     audit and is disclosed in the notice as cf.turnstile.u in localStorage
 *     on challenges.cloudflare.com; it is out of scope here by necessity,
 *     not by oversight.
 *   - Comments count as references in the static scan. That is deliberate:
 *     a server-side comment costs nothing, and an HTML comment explaining
 *     why we do not use sessionStorage would otherwise sit in the shipped
 *     output where it defeats exactly this kind of grep audit — which is
 *     what happened to the first draft of the removal.
