/**
 * The published "last updated" date on /privacy and /terms is a CLAIM ABOUT
 * CONTENT THAT CAN CHANGE UNDERNEATH IT.
 *
 * The date lives in src/data/site-content.ts; the prose lives in the page. They
 * can be edited independently, so someone can revise the privacy notice and
 * leave the date untouched — and the site then publishes a false statement
 * about when its privacy notice last changed. To a visitor, and potentially to
 * a regulator.
 *
 * This does NOT try to derive the date automatically. It should record when the
 * SUBSTANCE changed, which is a human judgement — a typo fix is not a revision.
 * Instead it pins the current wording so a change to it cannot pass silently:
 * edit the prose and this test fails, telling you to decide whether the date
 * should move.
 *
 * It hashes the rendered TEXT, not the markup or the source file, so a design
 * change or a refactor (both happened on 2026-08-22) does not trip it. Only the
 * words a reader actually sees.

  // not to collect personal data" — an absolute claim sendDefaultPii:false does
  // not support, since error messages/URLs can still carry incidental personal
  // data. Reworded to match the narrower, accurate framing already used in the
  // "when you just browse" section above it.
  //
  // Re-pinned later the SAME DAY (AUT-6472, item 4) for a second substantive
  // change: the Turnstile paragraph said it "may set a strictly-necessary
  // cookie". Measured, it sets no cookie — it writes cf.turnstile.u to
  // localStorage on challenges.cloudflare.com. The notice now names that exact
  // behaviour, scopes its no-storage claim around the contact-page exception,
  // and ties the PECR reliance to the requested contact-form service instead
  // of describing security as a blanket exception.
  // The date does NOT move: it already reads 23 August 2026, which is still
  // the day the substance changed.
