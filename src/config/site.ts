/**
 * Contact form submission target — the finalised AUTD lead-intake endpoint.
 *
 * NO third-party form processors (Formspree, Netlify Forms, Basin, etc.).
 * The previous site posted to Formspree; that is deliberately replaced. This
 * endpoint owns contact-form ingestion end to end.
 *
 * Contract (see src/pages/contact.astro for the client implementation):
 *   POST application/json, no credentials.
 *   Body: { name, email, company?, message, turnstileToken, website }
 *         `website` is a honeypot — must submit empty.
 *   Responses: 200 {ok:true}; any other status carries a MACHINE CODE in
 *              `error`. The codes and the copy a visitor sees for each are
 *              defined once in LEAD_ERROR_COPY below — that map IS the
 *              documentation, so there is one place to be wrong instead of a
 *              prose list here that silently goes stale when the API changes.
 *
 * NOTE: the API CORS origin is locked to https://automancer.uk, so live
 * submissions only succeed from the production origin — local `astro dev`
 * / preview will hit a CORS wall (expected), and the form degrades to the
 * mailto fallback there.

/**
 * Machine code -> copy a human wrote FOR A VISITOR.
 *
 * The lead API returns a bare code in `error` (turnstile_failed,
 * rate_limited, ...). Those are machine-readable BY DESIGN and it should keep
 * sending them — but a code is not user-facing copy, and rendering one
 * verbatim shows a visitor "turnstile_failed". This map is where the words a
 * person reads are decided, on the site, by us.
 *
 * ALLOWLIST, deliberately: a code we do not recognise falls through to
 * `LEAD_ERROR_FALLBACK`. We never surface a string that merely ARRIVED — that
 * is how an internal identifier or a provider error reaches a visitor.
 *
 * Adding a code here is the ONLY thing needed when the API grows a new one.
 * Until then an unknown code still gets honest copy and a working way to reach
 * us, rather than a dead end.
