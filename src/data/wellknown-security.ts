// The ONE payload behind BOTH routes:
//
//   /security.txt               (src/pages/security.txt.ts — SERVED by GitHub Pages)
//   /.well-known/security.txt   (injected in astro.config.mjs — standardised location)
//
// GitHub Pages does not serve dot-prefixed paths (measured live 2026-08-22,
// with .nojekyll present), so /security.txt is where the file actually
// resolves; the /.well-known/ route stays emitted for when the host supports
// it. Canonical MUST name a URL the file is really served from (RFC 9116
// §3), so it points at /security.txt: a Canonical resolving to a 404 makes
// the whole document non-conformant.
//
// Expires is REQUIRED by RFC 9116 and is generated at build time (~1 year
// out), so it never goes stale silently.
