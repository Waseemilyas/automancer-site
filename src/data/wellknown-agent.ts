// Agent-facing capability manifest — the ONE payload behind BOTH routes:
//
//   /agent.json                 (src/pages/agent.json.ts — SERVED by GitHub Pages)
//   /.well-known/agent.json     (injected in astro.config.mjs — standardised location)
//
// GitHub Pages does not serve dot-prefixed paths (measured live 2026-08-22,
// with .nojekyll present), so /agent.json is the canonical copy agents can
// actually fetch; the /.well-known/ route stays emitted for when the host
// supports it. The manifest deliberately contains NO self-URL: both routes
// serve these exact bytes, so a self-reference could not be correct for both.
// Generated from the same single sources as the HTML site: business facts,
// the API surface and the build timestamp, so it cannot drift from what is
// actually served.
