We make small businesses run like magic. It's not magic. It's very good engineering.

Automancer builds the software and AI agents that do the boring, expensive, error-prone work your team shouldn't be doing by hand. Real systems, sensible prices, and a human who answers.

## This whole company is run by AI. On purpose.

Most consultancies will tell you AI is the future. We handed ours the keys — the finance ops, the project tracking, this website, the field notes. We don't demo automation in a slide deck; we live inside it. A human — Waseem — makes every decision and takes every call.

- **Finance, watched daily** — agents track every pound of spend by account and prepare the invoices. Waseem approves and issues them. The bookkeeping is still done by hand.
- **Self-tracking delivery** — every project lane is governed and monitored by agents, board-gated before anything touches a client.
- **This site & blog** — written, built and maintained by the same agents we'd put to work in your business.
- **One human in the loop** — every decision. Every call. No call centre, no "your ticket is important to us".

## What we do

If a person on your team spends hours copying data between systems, re-keying spreadsheets, chasing approvals, or answering the same question for the hundredth time — that's a job for a machine.

1. **Workflow automation** — the repetitive, multi-step admin between your tools, stitched into one clean flow.
2. **Custom systems & portals** — proper software built for how you actually work, not an off-the-shelf box you bend yourself around.
3. **AI agents** — software that reads, decides, drafts and acts, with a human keeping control of anything that matters.
4. **AI Ops partnership** — we stay on, keep it running, and automate the next thing. Cancel anytime.

Most consultancies talk about AI. Automancer is one. The finance, the project tracking, the website you're reading — all run by agents. Every decision and every call — run by Waseem.

## Why "Automancer"?

An automancer works magic through machines. That's the joke, and it's also the honest job description. We make small businesses run like they're enchanted — admin that does itself, systems that talk to each other, work that just quietly happens overnight — and then we tell you plainly that it isn't magic at all. It's very good engineering, pointed at the boring problems that cost you the most.

Small businesses have been priced out of proper automation for years. We think that's daft. The technology to fix it is here, it's cheaper than ever, and there's no reason a care provider in Bradford or a manufacturer in Manchester shouldn't have systems as sharp as anyone's.

So we built a consultancy to prove it — by running the consultancy itself on exactly the tools we sell.

## The business is the demo

Automancer's own back office is run by AI agents: finance operations, project tracking, this website, the field notes. And then there's the line we will never cross: **a human makes every decision and takes every call.** That human is Waseem. The agents draft, calculate, monitor and propose. Waseem decides.

We're this open for two reasons. One, honesty: you deserve to know what's automated and what isn't. Two, it *is* the pitch — we already ran the experiment on ourselves.

## Meet Waseem

Automancer is founded and run by Waseem Ilyas — an engineer who got tired of watching good small businesses drown in admin that a machine could do in seconds. Before Automancer, he spun out and ran a live SaaS product business, so he has shipped real software that real people pay for and depend on.

He works with clients across social care, manufacturing, professional services and travel — from a ~600-person care provider's digital transformation to a one-page website for a brand-new travel agency. When you work with Automancer, you work with Waseem.

`;
}

function contactBody(): string {
  return `# Tell us what's eating your week.

No calendar gauntlet. No chatbot. No twelve-step sales sequence.

## How to reach a human

- **Web form:** ${abs('/contact')} (requires JavaScript and a browser security check)
- **Email:** ${business.email}
- **Phone:** ${business.phone} — a voicemail line; leave a message and it reaches Waseem, same as the form.

Based in ${business.address.addressLocality} · Leeds · Manchester · UK-wide, remote-first.

## The one-week promise

One week to a meeting, from first contact. Not a number in the diary three weeks out, not an automated "someone will be in touch" — an actual conversation with an actual human, within seven days.

## What happens after you hit send

1. **Your message enters our pipeline** — it lands in the same project system our AI agents run. Nothing gets lost, nothing sits ignored in an inbox.
2. **Waseem reads it. Personally.** No auto-responder pretending to be a person.
3. **You get a personal email back** — to arrange a proper conversation within one week of first contact.
4. **We take it from there** — usually an Automation Audit, but if a quick pointer is all you need, we'll happily give you that too.

Agents — use email. The form needs a browser; a plain email reaches the same human.
