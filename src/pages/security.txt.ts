// /security.txt — the SERVED copy of the RFC 9116 security.txt file.
//
// GitHub Pages does not serve dot-prefixed paths (measured live 2026-08-22:
// /.well-known/security.txt returns 404 in production even with .nojekyll
// in the artifact), so this non-dot route is where the file actually
// resolves — and it is therefore the URL the Canonical field names. Both
// this route and /.well-known/security.txt render from the single field
// builder in src/data/wellknown-security.ts, so the two copies cannot drift.
